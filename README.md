# Mini Baheth

A simple, self-hosted web UI for searching through text files using `ripgrep` and `ripgrep-all`.

## Features

- Streaming results realtime to the UI.
- Context lines (before/after) and matching text highlighting.
- Directory and file-pattern filtering.
- Fast first paint: only root-level directories initially; fetch more on demand.
- Modal preview for files; DOCX/DOC are converted to text for readability.
- `rga` adapters for more formats:
  - DOCX: via `pandoc` (built-in `rga` adapter)
  - DOC: via `antiword` ([custom adapter](https://github.com/phiresky/ripgrep-all/discussions/272))
  - JSON: via `gron` ([custom adapter](https://github.com/phiresky/ripgrep-all/discussions/176)) to flatten keys/values
 - Responsive design using Tailwind CSS.

## Technology Stack

- Backend: Python, NanoDjango, Granian (ASGI Server)
- Search: ripgrep (rg), ripgrep-all (rga)
- Frontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS (via CDN), htmx
- Packaging & Runtime: Docker, uv

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yshalsager/mini-baheth.git
cd mini-baheth
```

2.  **Prepare Environment:**

Create a .env and fill in the required information as defined in [mise.toml] env section:

```dotenv
# Hostname for Traefik (if using the override)
# TRAEFIK_HOST=baheth.yourdomain.com

# Optional: Override default Granian settings
# GRANIAN_PORT=5001
# GRANIAN_WORKERS=8
# GRANIAN_THREADS=4
```

3.  **Place your data:**

Put or symlink the directories and files you want to search inside the `data/` directory. Symlinks are followed safely with cycle protection.

### Docker

The image installs:
- ripgrep, ripgrep-all
- pandoc (DOCX), antiword (DOC), gron (JSON)

It ships an rga config at `/etc/rga/config.json` that enables custom adapters for antiword and gron.

Build and run:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

### Manual

### Without Docker

1. Ensure you have Python 3.13+ and uv.
2. Install Python deps: `uv sync`
3. Install system tools:
   - ripgrep, ripgrep-all
   - pandoc (DOCX), antiword (DOC), gron (JSON)
   - Any other system-level dependencies (refer to the Dockerfile for a complete list)
4. Run the application:

```bash
uv run granian app:app.asgi
```

The application should now be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (or the `GRANIAN_PORT` you configured).

### Notes
- The server chooses `rga` when the file filter is `*.doc`, `*.docx`, or `*.json`, otherwise it uses `rg`. When using `rga`, it passes `--rga-config-file=rga.config.json` if present (or `/etc/rga/config.json` in Docker).
- Modal preview: `.docx` uses pandoc; `.doc` uses antiword; other files are read as text.

## Traefik Integration (Optional)

An example override file is provided for integrating with a Traefik reverse proxy setup.

1.  **Copy the example override file:**

```bash
cp docker-compose.override.yml.example docker-compose.override.yml
```

2.  **Configure Hostname:**
    *   Edit the `.env` file and set `TRAEFIK_HOST` to the public hostname you want to use (e.g., `TRAEFIK_HOST=baheth.yourdomain.com`).
3.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure Traefik is running and connected to an external Docker network named `web`.
4.  **Run:** Start the stack using `docker compose up --build -d`. Traefik will automatically pick up the labels and route traffic.

## Files & Directories

*   `app.py`: Main NanoDjango application, defines routes and search logic.
*   `templates/`: HTML templates for the UI.
*   `data/`: Mount point for the files/directories you want to search.
*   `Dockerfile`: Defines the Docker image build process.
*   `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the Docker Compose service for development/basic deployment.
*   `docker-compose.override.yml.example`: Example override for Traefik integration.
*   `pyproject.toml`: Project metadata and Python dependencies (managed by `uv`).

## Acknowledgements

This project relies on several fantastic open-source tools:

*   [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) for its incredibly fast search capabilities.
    *   [Ripgrep-all](https://github.com/phiresky/ripgrep-all) for its ability to search through more file types.
    *   [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) for its ability to convert DOCX to text.
    *   [Antiword](https://repology.org/project/antiword/information) for its ability to convert DOC to text.
    *   [Gron](https://github.com/tomnomnom/gron) for its ability to convert JSON to text.
*   [NanoDjango](https://github.com/radiac/nanodjango) for providing a minimal Django-like web framework.
*   [Granian](https://github.com/emmett-framework/granian) as the high-performance ASGI server.
*   [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast Python packaging and resolution.
*   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the utility-first CSS framework.
*   [htmx](https://htmx.org/) for simplifying dynamic HTML interactions.


## Development

This project uses several tools to streamline the development process:

### mise

[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) is used for managing project-level dependencies and environment variables. mise helps
ensure consistent development environments across different machines.

To get started with mise:

1. Install mise by following the instructions on the [official website](https://mise.jdx.dev/).
2. Run `mise install` in the project root to set up the development environment.

### UV

[UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is used for dependency management and packaging. It provides a clean,
version-controlled way to manage project dependencies.

To set up the project with UV:

1. Install UV by following the instructions on the [official website](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
2. Run `uv sync` to install project dependencies.
